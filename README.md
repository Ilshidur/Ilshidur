### Hi !

<!--Ilshidur:OVERVIEW:start-->
I'm Nicolas, and I'm <!--Ilshidur:AGE:start-->25<!--Ilshidur:AGE:end-->.

I'm a full stack developer. I mainly use **Node.js** and **Vue**, and formerly used React, PHP & jQuery.
Modernity is a special interest of mine, so I keep myself updated by attending multiple public events like meetups or conferences. My current whim is **cloud architectures and distributed systems**.
My ultimate goal is to keep aiming for better skills and continuously improve.

I'm also interested by the DevOps philosophy, that I practice on **Terraform**, **Ansible** & **Kubernetes**.
I consider myself a Jack of all trades, as I often develop interests in areas close to mine and I like expanding my confort zone. I accept responsibilities and all challenges.

I aspire to be a solution architect some day.
